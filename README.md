# Java CLI Utils

Java Maven project where I try to do and learn different things with Java. The main program contains sub programs which can be executed with right commands and arguments.

# Commands

All commands except ?exit takes arguments. Arguments are separated with space.

- ?calculate [arg] calculates result from given string using JavaScript engine

- ?ufoname [arg...arg] creates weird name based on given strings

- ?irc [arg(BotName) arg(server) arg(#Channel)] connects to irc

- ?timer [arg((int)time|h|m|s) arg(Timer name)...arg(Timer name)] sets timer

- ?exit disconnects irc and quits the main program

# Dependencies
