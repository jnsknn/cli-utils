# Java CLI Utils

Java Maven project where I try to do and learn different things with Java. The main program contains sub programs which can be executed with right commands and arguments.

# Commands

- !calculate <arg> calculates result from given string using JavaScript engine

- !ufoname <arg...arg> creates weird name based on given strings

- !exit quits the main program
